# Graph Store Documentation
This repository contains documentation relating to Graph Store.
It is still being actively worked on, especially as graph-store and the code surrounding it are also evolving.
If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to file an issue. I'll also be periodically checking for PRs if you have any corrections.
